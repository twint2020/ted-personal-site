    <p>I’m Ted Wint. I’m a founding member and operations lead focused on launching and scaling a rapidly growing global, purpose-built urban fulfillment network that unlocks new markets for brands via q-commerce based in Los Angeles.</p>

    <p>Previously, I led an operations and strategy team at Winc, a modern winery with a direct connection to the consumer and before that, I managed operations at Tapcheck Inc., an early-stage FinTech startup. Let’s connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedwint/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm active on the Dornsife Alumni Advisory Council as the Strategic Planning Committee Chair and I also serve as the Vice Curator in the LA Global Shaper Hub for the World Economic Forum. Previously, I led the Marketing Committee on the USC Young Alumni Council. I'm interested in harnessing the transformative power of technology to elevate brands, investing in the mission of health & wellness, and reimagining the future of global retail.</p>

    <p>I occasionally write about culture, ideas and other topics I'm interested in. Read about it <a href="https://medium.com/@tedwint">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm a graduate of the University of Southern California with a B.A. in International Relations (Global Business). I was born in Rangoon, Burma, and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
